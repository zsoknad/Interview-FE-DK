# Summary of Work and TO-DO's

### For the sake of time, certain tasks were not yet implemented

Here is a list of tasks that could improve this project:
- Add option to 'load' previously saved statistics from local storage
- Form errors only exist after initial submit (want to show error class on house type input for example if nothing selected prior to first submit)
- Mobile responsiveness (Bar Chart and Form are not optimized for smaller viewports).
- Component Reusability: Best to move functions, type definitions, components into separate files where possible... `Home.tsx` is way too busy. Will help in reusing components/types/functions as the app scales.
- I'm sure I missed some type definitions
- Need to perform better type/error checking on url params, incorrect values may prevent the page/form from rendering
